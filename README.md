# 🚀 React.js 20-Day Challenge

Welcome to my **React.js 20-Day Challenge**!  
This challenge is focused on building a solid understanding of React by learning and building something new every day.

I'll update this repository daily with:
- What I learned
- Code snippets or mini-projects
- Tools and technologies used

> 📅 **Start Date**: May 26, 2025

## 📌 Day-by-Day Progress

### ✅ Day 1 – May 27, 2025

**Topics Covered**:
- 🔧 React Environment Setup (Node.js, Vite, VS Code)
- ⚛️ Created First Vite + React App
- 🧩 Understanding React Components (Function Components)
- ✨ How JSX Works Under the Hood
- 🖊️ Rendering Text in React
- 🔀 Conditional Rendering Techniques
- 🎯 Event Handling in React (e.g., `onClick`, `onChange`)

**Tools Used**:
- Node.js v22.16.0
- Vite
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & GitHub

**Summary**:
Today I started my React.js journey by setting up the development environment and learning the basic concepts of React. I created a new Vite + React project, learned how JSX works, explored how components render, handled user events, and implemented conditional rendering logic. I also uploaded the code to GitHub for version tracking.

### ✅ Day 2 – May 28, 2025

**Topics Covered**:
- 🧠 React Props and State
- 🔁 Dynamic Rendering with `map()`
- 🎯 Event Handling with Parameters
- 🔄 `useState` Hook Deep Dive
- 💡 Intro to `useRef` Hook

**Video Resource**:
- 📺 [React.js Tutorial for Beginners – Day 2 (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbAdFfSdtQ4)

**Summary**:
On Day 2, I explored how to pass data using **props**, manage interactive state with **`useState`**, and how to dynamically render content using **arrays**. I also learned about handling events with parameters and the initial use cases of the **`useRef` hook**, which allows us to interact directly with DOM elements or persist values across renders.

### ✅ Day 3 – May 29, 2025

**Topics Covered**:
- 🔁 Advanced use of JavaScript `map()` to render dynamic lists
- ⚙️ Managing array-based state using `useState`
- 🧠 Deeper understanding of the `useRef` Hook:
  - Referencing DOM elements
  - Storing mutable values without triggering re-renders
- 🧹 Learned how to structure reusable components with dynamic data
- 🚀 Hands-on with rendering form inputs dynamically and tracking their values

**Summary**:
Today’s session was all about working with **arrays** and building more dynamic, data-driven components in React. I practiced rendering UI elements using `map()`, managing user interaction through `useState`, and explored how `useRef` can help store mutable values or interact directly with the DOM. I also understood when to use `useRef` vs `useState`, which cleared up some confusion. These concepts helped me see how React efficiently updates the UI and handles user data.

### ✅ Day 4 – May 30, 2025

**Topic Covered**:
- 🧩 JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces

**Summary**:
Today I explored how JavaScript expressions can be embedded directly inside JSX using curly braces `{}`. I learned how to:
- Render variables inside JSX
- Use expressions and function calls within JSX
- Combine text and expressions dynamically
- Handle inline conditional rendering (e.g., `condition ? value1 : value2`)

I followed and practiced directly from the official React docs:
